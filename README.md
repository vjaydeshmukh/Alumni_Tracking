# Alumni Tracking
It is an alumni portal for university where different college manage their alumni. Here alumni can register or login, write or edit blogs, create event or internships and can fund projects where students can only view these or apply for internships. Alumni also can make friends there and chat as well. And can do many things.

Features:

Note:
Verification system is not working right now, because I removed the credentials for security reasons. If you want to use generate key from Gmail for your email id and paste that key to the keys.txt (in the alumni system folder In the second line). And replace all email with your email id in collection.py (In Alumni Tracking Folder)
